# Checkin Admin — project context

Admin panel for **checkin.co.in** (Hotel Arco Palace check-in software).
Live, in production. This file is the handover: read it before changing anything.

## What it is

Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Postgres. A password-protected
admin area with a dashboard and an SMS list, plus two APIs that let the hotel's
check-in software and its SMS gateway push messages in.

The **public site at `/`** is the owner's original checkin.co.in marketing site, restored
from the Wayback Machine snapshot of 2 Apr 2023 (`20230402024347`). It is plain static
HTML in `public/` — `index.html` (also `index-2.html`), `aboutus.html`, `service.html`,
`contact_us.html`, `client.html`, plus `css/`, `js/`, `images/`. A rewrite in
`next.config.ts` maps `/` to `/index.html`; there is no `app/page.tsx`. Do not "modernise"
these files unasked — they are a faithful restore. Known gaps: the homepage Flash banner
(`flash/checkin banner.swf`) cannot play in any current browser, the `Check-In.msi` and
`SMSExcel2007AddInSetup.msi` download links were not restored, and `client.html` was
already a MySQL error page when the snapshot was taken.

## Live URLs

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Site | https://checkin.co.in — admin at `/admin` |
| Fallback | https://checkin-admin-ten.vercel.app |
| Repo | https://github.com/hotelarcopalace-glitch/checkin-admin (private) |
| Vercel project | `checkin-admin` in scope `hotelarcopalace-glitchs-projects` |

Admin username is `admin`. The password is only in `.env.local` (never committed) and
in the Vercel env vars as a scrypt hash. Lost it? Run `npm run gen:admin` and update
`ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in Vercel, then redeploy.

## Infrastructure

- **Hosting:** Vercel, auto-deploys on every push to `main`. The Vercel CLI is logged in
  on the owner's Mac, so `vercel env`, `vercel redeploy`, `vercel domains` all work.
- **Database:** Neon Postgres, resource `neon-citrine-tree`, free plan, Singapore region,
  provisioned through the Vercel marketplace. It injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically —
  **never set that variable by hand.**
- **Domain:** checkin.co.in is registered at **GoDaddy** (nameservers `domaincontrol.com`).
  There is no GoDaddy API access here; DNS edits are manual, done by the owner.
  Current records: `A @ → 64.29.17.1`, `CNAME www → 8e06b7d491dac3d9.vercel-dns-017.com`.
  SSL is Let's Encrypt, issued and renewed by Vercel.
- The owner also has a **Hostinger** account (arcoautozone.in/.com, carspareparts.co.in,
  and a KVM 2 VPS running WordPress). Unrelated to this project — do not touch it.

## Environment variables

`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `SMS_API_KEY`,
`DATABASE_URL` (from Neon), optional `DB_POOL_MAX`, `SITE_URL`, `OTP_SKIP`.

Push notifications additionally need `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`,
`FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` (server) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` (client). **All of these are set in Vercel** (production,
preview and development) and push has been confirmed working on a real Android phone.

Firebase project is **`checkin-3715a`**, service account
`firebase-adminsdk-u7h1t@checkin-3715a.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. The downloaded service
account JSON lives at `~/Downloads/checkin-3715a-firebase-adminsdk-u7h1t-b90d130418.json`
on the owner's Mac — it is the only local copy of the private key, and it is **not** in the
repo. Regenerate it from the Firebase console if it is ever lost.

Two Vercel CLI traps when setting these: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are rejected as
"sensitive", so they need `--no-sensitive --visibility config`; and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
starts with `-----BEGIN`, which the CLI reads as a flag, so it must be piped through stdin
rather than passed with `--value`. Always confirm with `vercel env ls` afterwards — adds
can fail silently.

## Guest login and push

`/user/login` takes a mobile number, issues a six-digit OTP into `otp_codes`, and
`/user` shows that number's messages plus a "turn on notifications" button. The button
asks for browser permission, gets an FCM token and stores it in `device_tokens`.
`lib/sms-insert.ts` then pushes to every token on that number after each insert, logging
outcomes to `notification_log`.

`OTP_SKIP` defaults to **true**: any code is accepted and the code is returned in the API
response and shown on screen, because there is no SMS gateway yet. **Anyone can therefore
log in as any number and read its messages** — the owner accepted this for now. Set
`OTP_SKIP=false` the moment SMS sending works.

FCM uses the HTTP v1 API with a service account; `lib/fcm.ts` mints the Google OAuth token
itself with `jose`, so `firebase-admin` is deliberately not a dependency. Dead tokens are
deleted when Google reports UNREGISTERED.

Multi-login behaviour is tested and works: one number may register up to 20 devices and
every one of them is pushed; different numbers can be logged in at the same time and never
see each other's messages; and if a second number logs in on a browser that already has a
token, the token moves to the new number (`ON CONFLICT (token) DO UPDATE`). Push failures
never fail the insert — the vendor always gets `code: 0`.

Note that `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time, so changing them needs a real
rebuild. When push silently does nothing, check in this order: the JSON response's `push`
field (`no devices registered` means the browser never registered), then the browser's own
permission state — the toggle prints a diagnostics line (`permission · serviceWorker ·
push · secure`) under the button for exactly this.

## Endpoints

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | — | admin login, sets a 12h signed JWT cookie |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | — | clears the cookie |
| `GET /api/sms/export` | admin session | CSV of the current filter |
| `POST /api/admin/db-setup` | admin session | applies `db/schema.sql`, `?seed=1` adds demo rows. Idempotent. |
| `POST /api/admin/clear-sms` | admin session | deletes every message; body must be `{"confirm":"DELETE"}` |
| `POST /api/sms/log` | `SMS_API_KEY` | structured insert, 1–100 messages, full validation |
| `GET\|POST /api/sms/SMSInsert` | **none — open** | vendor endpoint: `mobileNo` + `smsText`, returns `{code:0}` / `{code:1}` |

`SMSInsert` is also served at `/api/sms/insert` and `/newadmin/api/sms/SMSInsert`;
all three share `lib/sms-insert.ts`. It mirrors the contract of the owner's existing
hotelarcopalace.com API so the SMS vendor needs no changes. It is deliberately
unauthenticated at the owner's request — only a 60/minute per-IP limit guards it.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- **Vercel env vars added through the dashboard came back empty at runtime.** Names showed
  in `vercel env ls` but `process.env` was blank. Re-adding them with `vercel env add`
  fixed it. Always verify at runtime, not just in the listing.
- **Sensitive env vars cannot be read back** — `vercel env pull` returns `[SENSITIVE]`.
  That is why `/api/admin/db-setup` exists: it runs the schema from inside the deployment
  where `DATABASE_URL` is available.
- **Marketplace integrations need the owner to accept vendor terms in a browser.**
  `vercel integration add` fails until they do.
- **Env var changes need a redeploy** (`vercel redeploy <url>`) to take effect.
- After a DNS change, browsers cache the old IP and certificate for a while — verify with
  `curl --resolve` before assuming something is broken.

## Working style that fits this project

- There is no local Postgres. To test database code, install `@electric-sql/pglite` and
  `@electric-sql/pglite-socket` with `--no-save`, serve on a port, and point
  `DATABASE_URL` at it with `DB_POOL_MAX=1` (the socket server takes one connection).
  Clean the packages up afterwards.
- Verify against the live site with `curl` before telling the owner it works.
- The owner writes in Hinglish and prefers that back. They want the work done for them,
  not instructions — do every step you can and only hand over what genuinely needs their
  account access.

## State as of 22 Aug 2026

Live and verified end to end:

- Public site at `/` (restored 2023 snapshot), admin at `/admin`, guest area at `/user`.
- Both insert APIs, CSV export, filters, clear-messages action.
- Guest login by mobile number, device registration, and **real push delivered to an
  Android phone** (`{"push":{"sent":1,"failed":0}}`).

The database is **empty** — every demo and test row was cleared after testing.

**Pending, in the owner's priority order:**

1. **Real OTP sending.** `OTP_SKIP=true`, so any code is accepted and the code is shown on
   screen. Anyone can therefore log in as any number and read its messages and take its
   notifications. This must be closed before guests use it — the SMS vendor already calls
   `SMSInsert`, so sending the OTP through the same gateway is the obvious route. Then set
   `OTP_SKIP=false`.
2. **The homepage Flash banner.** The 2023 site embeds `flash/checkin banner.swf`, which no
   browser can play, leaving a blank band on the homepage. The owner asked for a static
   image in its place; not done yet.
3. **Legacy Cloud Messaging API** is still enabled in Firebase and its server key was
   visible in a screenshot the owner shared. It was deprecated in 2024 and nothing here
   uses it — worth disabling.

Also raised earlier: pulling logs directly from the SMS provider (MSG91/Textlocal/
Fast2SMS/Twilio — not chosen), serving the same API on hotelarcopalace.com, and more admin
pages (bookings, guests, reports).
